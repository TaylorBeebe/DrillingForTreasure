# DrillingForTreasure
A simple, horde-mode style game with a humorous twist made for the 42nd Ludum Dare Game Jam. The gameplay revolves around defeating waves of enemies to protect a drill that’s gathering resources. On top of increasingly difficult enemies, the game spawns satirical on-screen ads that mock the “freemium” game model.
